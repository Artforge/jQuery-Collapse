# jQuery Collapse

A lightweight plugin that allows you to collapse content, a feature also
known as 'progressive disclosure'.

Dependencies:
- jQuery 1.7.2

Enjoy!

## Features

- [WAI ARIA](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introduction-to-wai-aria/) compliant
- Lightweight (~x bytes minified and Gzipped)
- Cross Browser compliant (Tested in >= IE6, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera)
- **Accordion** plugin (optional)
- **Persist** plugin for client side persistance! (optional)


## Usage

Load jQuery and the plugin into your document.

```html
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.collapse.js"></script>
```

Here's some sample HTML markup:

```html
<div id="demo" data-collapse>
  <h3>Fruits</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li>Pear</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Info</h3>
  <div>
    <p>You can use any container you like (in this case a div element)</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

That's it! The *data-collapse* attribute will automatically trigger the script. 


## Custom usage

If you'd rather omit the 'data-collapse' attribute in the HTML and load the plugin via jQuery, you can:

```js
$(function() {
  $("#demo").collapse({
    // options...
  });
});
```

If you don't want to use the jQuery ($) wrapper, you can also access the
plugin with vanilla JavaScript:

```js
new Collapse($("#demo"), {
  // options...
});
```


## Accordion plugin

If you want to add accordion functionality load the accordion plugin *after* you load jquery.collapse.js

```html
<script src="jquery.collapse.accordion.js"></script>
```

To activate the plugin set 'accordion' as the value of 'data-collapse'
attribute:

```html
<div id="demo" data-collapse="accordion">
  ...
</div>
```


## Persist plugin

By default, if the user reloads the page all the sections will be closed. If you want previously collapsed sections to stay open, you can use
the persist plugin. Load it *after* you load jquery.collapse.js

```html
<script src="jquery.collapse.persist.js"></script>
```

To enable persistance to a section, add 'persist' to the data-collapse attribute

```html
<div id="demo" data-collapse="persist">
  ...
</div>
```

The perist plugin uses HTML5 localStorage if available. Otherwise it
will attempt to use browser cookies, if that also fails, it will degrade
to work but without any persistance.

You can combine the accordion and persist plugin by adding
both values to the data-collapse attribute

```html
<div id="demo" data-collapse="accordion persist">
  ...
</div>
```
